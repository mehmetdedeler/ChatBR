{"bug_id": "2118", "title": "Bug 2118  Move project dialog confusing", "description": "Create a project In navigator, hit move.  In the resulting dialog, it doesn't tell me what it wants me to do.  The dialog title just says, \"Project\".  If I go to the location text box, and try to append something, an error message appears at the bottom, which is cut off so I can't read it.  There should be at least hoverhelp for long messages.  I assume it says \"local mapping overlap: d:/eclipse/target/JohnTest and d:/eclipse/target/OtherPlace\", which is a bit confusing... I think a user would ask, \"what's a local mapping?\", or,  \"How come it says two different directories overlap?\".   NOTES:"}
