{"bug_id": "16613", "title": "Bug 16613  \"Name filter patterns\" don't filter after relaunch", "description": "Build: 20020519  In the packages view, I have created a Name filter pattern, \"CVS*\".  It filters all of my CVS junk that I don't want to see.  When I restart Eclipse, the filter is not applied.  If I open the Java Element Filters dialog and hit Ok, it is applied and my CVS folders are filtered.  To reproduce this bug: 1. New workspace. 1.5 Switch to Java perspective. 2. New project \"X\". 3. New folder \"CVS\". 4. Open Java Element Filters from triangle pulldown off of the packages view. 5. Enter CVS* as a Name filter pattern, hit OK.  The CVS directory is filtered. 6. Shutdown Eclipse. 7. Restart Eclipse, the packages view shows the CVS directory"}
