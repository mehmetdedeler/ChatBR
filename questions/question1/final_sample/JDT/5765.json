{"bug_id": "5765", "title": "Bug 5765  New Class button in empty workspace should be more supportive", "description": "User feedback: \"Confused how to create my first project\" We should be more supportive in the UI for this special case since it is a  first time experience with the UI.  Therefore when the workbench is empty we should offer to create a new Java  project. Minimal solution is to show an info dialog that explains that user should  create a project first and offer a button to open the Java project wizard.  The same is true for the new package and new interface buttons."}
