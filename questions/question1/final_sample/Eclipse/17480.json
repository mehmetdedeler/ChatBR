{"bug_id": "17480", "title": "Bug 17480  Menus for Ole documents incorrect", "description": "Eclipse F1  1) Open an ole editor on a bitmap file 2) Open an ole eidtor on a word document 3) flip between the two tabs by clicking on the tabs. Notice that the menu is not the correct menu for the ole editor that is active.  The problem is that one editor is being activated and setting the menu and then  the other editor is being deactivated which wipes out the menu.  The fix is:  OleEditor.setFocus should do nothing:  public void setFocus() { }  and OleEditor.activateClientPart should activate the editor:  private void activateClient(IWorkbenchPart part) { \tif (part == this) { \t\toleActivate(); \t} }  Note that the method clientFrame.setFocus does not need to be called -  activation will take care of the focus."}
