{"bug_id": "23445", "title": "Bug 23445  [Perspectives] Select All in Window / Customize Perspective Doesn't Work", "description": "Opening Bug for Dave Ings:  This problem occurs on the 09/07 WSAD driver (which includes 2.0.1).  1. Make the resource perspective the default, and open it. 2. Go to Window / Customize Perspective and expand Window > Open Perspective.  About half a dozen perspectives are selected. 3. Select all perspectives by checking the \"root\" check box. Click OK. 4. Select the resource perspective and click on the \"Open a Perspective\" button  on the left hand toolbar. 5. Only 9 of the 16 perspectives are shown. 6. The same behaviour occurs if instead you invoke Window / Open Perspective.  I can't seem to find any preference that configures the length of the list of  perspectives.  I tried a similar test in Eclipse 2.0, and it works fine there."}
