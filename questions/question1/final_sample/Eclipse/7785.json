{"bug_id": "7785", "title": "Bug 7785  SaveAs Forgets the file type", "description": "1) Open an existing java file 2) Modify it (I moved an existing class) 3) Click the SaveAs icon, next to the Save Icon  A dialog will come up.  4) Browse for a valid container location 5) Type the filename, but ignore the extension, which isn't requested. 6) Click Ok.  Observe that the Navigator has added the file in the specified location, but  with no file extension shown. The icon has also changed from the parent java  file icon to a generic file icon. The file is for all intents and purposes now  a generic file, as opening it will prove--the file is opened as text.  Expected Behaviour:  The file should be saved with the same extension as the original unless  explicitly changed."}
