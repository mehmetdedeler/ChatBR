{"bug_id": "7206", "title": "Bug 7206  rename method parameters panel needs work", "description": "The panel for renaming methods has low usability.  The old names for the  parameters are unsorted --- they are not in declaration order or alphabetical  order.  If the names are not mneumonic (and why would you rename them otherwise) it is  hard to determine what to rename them to.  That is, should \"arg0\" be servlet,  mapping or request?  (I'm tripping across this renaming overloaded Struts  action methods).  I would suggest: 1) Sort by declaration order 2) Add a column to display the type 3) Merge this and the parameter ordering panel into a single operation"}
