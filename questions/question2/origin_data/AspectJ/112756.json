{"bug_id": "112756", "title": "Bug 112756 - Compilation error in aspect weaving", "description": "When compiling a project with aspect weaving enabled, I get a compilation error. The error occurs during the weaving process. The expected behavior is that the compilation should complete successfully without errors. To reproduce this issue: 1. Create a new Java project with AspectJ support 2. Add a simple aspect with a pointcut 3. Try to compile the project 4. The compilation fails with weaving errors. This should not happen and the compilation should succeed."}
