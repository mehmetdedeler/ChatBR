{"bug_id": "18310", "title": "Bug 18310  Preference Dialog gets too large for pages with tables", "description": "In a lower resolution mode if a preference page has a table (like the installed JREs) it is possible for the page to get too large to fit onto the screen rela estate. The size of the table is dependant on the size of the previous pages composite - if it was a large on the preferred size of the table will be large.  I suggest we have a maximum page size - say 800x800 (we already have a 400 x 400 minimum).  Note that on Linux dialogs are resizable so we may want to defer this.  STEPS 1) Open the Preference Dialog 2) select the Installed JRE page. Table columns are truncated (correctly). 3) Select Ant preference page 4) Hit OK 5) Open the Preference Dialog - Ant is default selected and quite large 6) Selected installed JREs - button is cut off."}
