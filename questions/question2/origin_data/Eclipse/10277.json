When I double-click on a file in the project explorer, the editor window opens but shows no content. The file should open and display its contents in the editor. To reproduce this issue: 1. Open Eclipse IDE 2. Navigate to a Java file in the project explorer 3. Double-click to open the file 4. The editor opens but shows blank content. This prevents me from editing any files in the workspace."}
