{"bug_id": "2127", "title": "Bug 2127  Tasks Cell Editor does not close on deactivation (1GE7AN3)", "description": "I'm not sure if this is a bug.  It is very strange behavior, though.  1. Add a task to the task list. 2. Click on description to edit. 3. While cell editor is active click on navigator.  Notice activation is now in navigator, but cell editor in task list is still open. 4. Click back on title for tasks. 5. Move scroll bar up and down.  Notice how cell editor disappers momentarily while scrolling. 6. Now click on column headings to change order.  Notice how editor still remains.  The same problem occurs if the priority editor is active.  Expected behavior:  If I click off the task list the cell editor should be deactivated, as the part itself is deactivated.    NOTES:"}
