{"bug_id": "101372", "title": "Bug 101372 - Chart rendering issue", "description": "The chart is not rendering correctly in the report. When I try to display a pie chart, it shows as a blank area instead of the actual chart. The chart should display properly with all data points visible. To reproduce: 1. Create a new report with a pie chart 2. Add data to the chart 3. Preview the report 4. The chart appears blank instead of showing the data. This is a critical issue that affects report generation."}
